This is my training project of the online store with a few of microservices:
- frontend - React;
- backend - Node.js;
- MongoDB;
- rabbitmw;
- notifications - Python 3.9.

To start application in production mode you have to have installed Docker Deskop, Kubernetes CLI `kubectl` and a working plugin that creates a cluster.
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s
```
